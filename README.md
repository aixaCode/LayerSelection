Tool adapts to layers created in Unity editor.
Tool adds icon next to GameObject in hierarchy window, to easily detect and recognize layers. You can also disable the icons if you don’t like them.
From the editor window you can pick what layers you want to select – you can pick one, two or all.
There are setting to manipulate whole group or you can pick individually.
Then you click Select button. And magic happens :)
With button Reset, you reset your selection in editor window.

If you don’t want to open another editor window, you can just manipulate the selection by clicking the
icon next to GameObject in hierarchy view.
In Editor window you can adjust the color of the icon.
If you want to replace the image of the icon, just replace the picture in LayerSelectionTool folder.
Additional info:
Layer Selection Tool will select all objects on active scene, but will skip the inactive.
to change that you need to modify the code of LayerSelectionToolEditor. You need to replace 222 line in
code in function Select(). In the script there are possible ways to replace the code, with explanations.
